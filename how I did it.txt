This project is created in two parts

Part 1: The display
This describes the part of the game that displays the current standing/progress of the game.
X and Os is a game with 9 spots divided into three horizontal/vertical grids.
For this reason, I have decided to display those spots as list items from another list.
It will start with an initial arrangement as follows:
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9

If a number is selected within the logic described in Part 2, the number is replaced by either an "X" or an "O".
This is done until a straight line is formed.

Part 2: The user input
This is the part that takes in the user input, and does the  necessary programming to change the display described in
Part 1 above.
When a user types in a number, the equivalent number in the list in Part 1 is replaced by either an "X" or an "O"
When a straight line of a similar "X" or "O" exists in the display, the winner is determined.
There are 8 possible winning patterns that can be achieved. These can be placed in a list which will be iterated on
